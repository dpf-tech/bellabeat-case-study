Analyzing Consumer Fitness Behavior Using Bellabeat Data

A Python-based exploration of activity, calories, and sleep patterns

Project Overview

This project examines a public Fitbit dataset to understand how people move, burn calories, and sleep throughout the day. The goal was to identify behavior patterns that could help Bellabeat improve how their wellness products support users.

The work includes data cleaning, exploration, custom visualizations, and a final formatted report.

Key Findings
Activity Patterns

Most users fall between 6,000 and 9,000 steps per day.

A smaller group consistently reaches 15,000+ steps, showing clearly active behavior.

Around 15–20% log fewer than 2,000 steps, which may indicate sedentary routines or limited device usage.

Calories

There is a noticeable positive relationship between the number of steps and calories burned.

Users who move more burn more energy, and the pattern is consistent across the dataset.

Sleep

There’s no strong connection between how much someone walks and how long they sleep.

Most users average 5.5 to 7.5 hours of sleep—slightly below general health recommendations.

Recommendations

Introduce step-based challenges to help users stay active.

Highlight calorie-burn data within Bellabeat’s app and product messaging.

Treat sleep analytics as a supportive feature rather than something linked to physical activity.

Encourage users to focus on long-term progress instead of day-to-day fluctuations.
