Analyzing Consumer Fitness Behavior Using Bellabeat Data

A Python-based case study exploring how daily steps, calorie expenditure, and sleep duration relate to consumer fitness behavior. This project uses public Fitbit data and replicates a real-world analytics workflow: cleaning, merging datasets, generating visual insights, and producing a polished final report.

📌 Project Overview

Bellabeat is a wellness technology company that designs smart devices for women.
This case study analyzes user activity patterns to help understand:

Typical daily movement levels

How steps influence calorie burn

Whether activity levels relate to sleep duration

The goal is to extract meaningful behavioral insights that can inform product positioning and user-engagement strategies.

🧠 Research Questions

What does the distribution of daily steps reveal about overall activity levels?

How strongly are daily steps associated with calories burned?

Is there a noticeable relationship between daily steps and sleep duration?

🛠️ Methodology (Python Workflow)

Imported and cleaned datasets: daily activity, daily steps, and sleep logs.

Standardized date formats and merged datasets on Id + Date.

Addressed missing values and ensured dataset consistency.

Generated visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn.

Interpreted results and consolidated insights for Bellabeat’s context.

📝 Insights & Interpretation
Activity Patterns

Most users average 6,000–9,000 steps/day, below recommended levels.

A smaller group regularly exceeds 15,000 steps/day, showing high activity.

~15–20% record very low steps (<2,000), suggesting sedentary behavior or inconsistent device use.

Calories & Activity

Strong positive correlation between daily steps and calories burned.

Higher-activity users consistently burn more calories.

Sleep Behavior

No clear linear relationship between steps and sleep duration.

Most users sleep 5.5–7.5 hours, slightly below ideal ranges.

🎯 Recommendations

Encourage step-based challenges to promote daily movement.

Highlight calorie-burn tracking in Bellabeat's marketing materials.

Treat sleep metrics as a complementary feature rather than activity-dependent.

Help users focus on long-term habit trends, not short-term fluctuations.
